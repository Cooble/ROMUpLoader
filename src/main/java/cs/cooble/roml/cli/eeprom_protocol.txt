EEPROM PROTOCOL
This protocol is used to communicate with flasher via Serial Interface
to flash content to eeprom and then read from it and validate it.


-> Note everyOutcomming package (sent to Flasher) must start with 'o' and end with 'p'

===GET EEPROM SIZE===
    *ask flasher for eeprom size
    's'

    *flasher responds
    's' + [size in decimal string]


===READ ONE BYTE===
    *ask flasher to send it value on this address
    'r' + [MSB_ADDRESS] + [LSB_ADDRESS]

    *flasher responds
    'r' + [VALUE]


===READ WHOLE MEMORY===
    *ask flasher to send him contents of entire memory starting from address 0
    't'

    *flasher responds
    'a'
    't' + [VALUE[0]]
    't' + [VALUE[1]]
    't' + [VALUE[2]]
    ...
    'ty'


===WRITE ONE BYTE===
    *tell flasher to write byte into eeprom
    'w' + [MSB_ADDRESS] + [LSB_ADDRESS] + [VALUE]

    *flasher responds ready
    'y'



===WRITE WHOLE MEMORY===
    *puts flasher into whole memory rewrite mode
    "u"

    *flasher responds ready
    'y'

    *tell flasher to write byte into eeprom
    'w' + [VALUE[0]] 'w' + [VALUE[1]]...

    *flasher responds ready or repeat
    'y' / 'n'

    ...

    *tell flasher to write byte into eeprom
    'w' + [VALUE[n]] 'w' + [VALUE[n+1]]

    *flasher responds ready or failure
    'y' / 'n'

    ...


===CLEAR WHOLE MEMORY===
    *tell flasher to clear whole eeprom with '1'
    *before this man has to set OE to 12V
    "cccccc"

    *flasher responds ready
    'y'
